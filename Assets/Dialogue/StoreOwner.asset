  dialogue:
  - Hello there traveller!
  - It's amazing to see someone out here who isn't ready to attack me at first sights
    notice.
  - I'm a travelling merchant by the way.
  - I'd offer you something in case you're looking to buy, but I'm currently not
    set up yet.
  - Please come back in the near future when the Designers set up my shop...whatever
    that means.
